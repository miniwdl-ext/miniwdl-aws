# miniwdl configuration file built into the miniwdl-aws Docker image for use with
# miniwdl-aws-submit
#
# The easiest way to override these options is usually to set environment variables with the
# convention MINIWDL__{SECTION}__{KEY}={VALUE}. Full info on the miniwdl configuration loader:
#   https://miniwdl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/runner_reference.html#configuration
#
# Additionally, the following are also usually set via environment variables:
#   * MINIWDL__AWS__TASK_QUEUE: the desired AWS Batch queue
#   * MINIWDL__AWS__FSAP: EFS Access Point ID (fsap-xxxx)
#   * MINIWDL__AWS__FS: EFS file system ID (fs-xxxx) matching the access point; can be detected if
#                       omitted, but doing so requires IAM permission to DescribeAccessPoints.
