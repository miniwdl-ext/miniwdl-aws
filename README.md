# miniwdl AWS plugin

**Extends [miniwdl](https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/miniwdl) to run workflows on [AWS Batch](https://aws.amazon.com/batch/) and [EFS](https://aws.amazon.com/efs/)**

This miniwdl plugin enables it to submit AWS Batch jobs to execute WDL tasks. It uses EFS for work-in-progress file I/O, with optional S3 rails for workflow-level I/O.

The following assumes familiarity with [local use of `miniwdl run`](https://miniwdl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html).

## Use within Amazon SageMaker Studio

Start with the companion [**miniwdl-aws-studio**](https://github.com/miniwdl-ext/miniwdl-aws-studio) recipe to install miniwdl for interactive use within [Amazon SageMaker Studio](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/studio/), a web IDE with a terminal and filesystem browser. You can use the terminal to operate `miniwdl run` against AWS Batch, the filesystem browser to manage the inputs and outputs on EFS, and the Jupyter notebooks to further analyze the outputs.

That's the best way to try miniwdl-aws and get familiar with how it works with Batch and EFS. Read on for non-interactive deployment, which is a bit more complicated.

## Unattended operations

For non-interactive use, a command-line wrapper `miniwdl-aws-submit` *launches miniwdl in its own small Batch job* to orchestrate the workflow. This **workflow job** then spawns **task jobs** as needed, without needing the submitting computer (e.g. your laptop) to remain connected for the duration. Separate Batch compute environments handle workflow & task jobs, using lightweight [Fargate](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/fargate.html) resources for workflow jobs. (See below for detailed infra specs.)

### Submitting workflow jobs

First `pip3 install miniwdl-aws` locally to make the `miniwdl-aws-submit` program available. The following example launches a [viral genome assembly](https://github.com/broadinstitute/viral-pipelines/) that should run in 10-15 minutes:

```
miniwdl-aws-submit \
  https://github.com/broadinstitute/viral-pipelines/raw/v2.1.28.0/pipes/WDL/workflows/assemble_refbased.wdl \
  reads_unmapped_bams=https://github.com/broadinstitute/viral-pipelines/raw/v2.1.19.0/test/input/G5012.3.testreads.bam \
  reference_fasta=https://github.com/broadinstitute/viral-pipelines/raw/v2.1.19.0/test/input/ebov-makona.fasta \
  sample_name=G5012.3 \
  --workflow-queue miniwdl_workflow \
  --task-queue miniwdl_task \
  --fsap fsap-xxxx \
  --s3upload s3://MY_BUCKET/test \
  --follow
```

The command line resembles `miniwdl run`'s with extra AWS-related arguments:

|command-line argument|equivalent environment variable| |
|---------------------|-------------------------------|-|
| `--workflow-queue`  | `MINIWDL__AWS__WORKFLOW_QUEUE`| Batch job queue on which to schedule the *workflow* job |
| `--task-queue` | `MINIWDL__AWS__TASK_QUEUE` | Batch job queue on which to schedule *task* jobs |
| `--fsap` | `MINIWDL__AWS__FSAP` | [EFS Access Point](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/efs-access-points.html) ID, which workflow and task jobs will mount at `/mnt/efs` |
| `--s3upload` | | (optional) S3 folder URI under which to upload the workflow products, including the log and output files |

Unless `--s3upload` ends with /, one more subfolder is added to the uploaded URI prefix, equal to miniwdl's automatic timestamp-prefixed run name. If it does end in /, then the uploads go directly into/under that folder (and a repeat invocation would be expected to overwrite them).

Adding `--wait` makes the tool await the workflow job's success or failure, reproducing miniwdl's exit code. `--follow` does the same and also live-streams the workflow log. Without `--wait` or `--follow`, the tool displays the workflow job UUID and exits immediately.

Arguments not consumed by `miniwdl-aws-submit` are *passed through* to `miniwdl run` inside the workflow job; as are environment variables whose names begin with `MINIWDL__`, allowing override of any [miniwdl configuration option](https://miniwdl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/runner_reference.html#configuration) (disable wih `--no-env`). See [miniwdl_aws.cfg](miniwdl_aws.cfg) for various options preconfigured in the workflow job container.

## Run directories on EFS

Miniwdl runs the workflow in a directory beneath `/mnt/efs/miniwdl_run` (override with `--dir`). The outputs also remain cached there for potential reuse in future runs.

Given the EFS-centric I/O model, you'll need a way to manage the filesystem contents remotely. The companion recipe [lambdash-efs](https://github.com/miniwdl-ext/lambdash-efs) is one option. Or deploy an instance/container mounting your EFS, to access via SSH or web app (e.g. [JupyterHub](https://jupyter.org/hub), [Cloud Commander](http://cloudcmd.io/), [VS Code server](https://github.com/cdr/code-server)).

You can also automate cleanup of EFS run directories by setting `miniwdl-aws-submit --s3upload` and:

* `--delete-after success` to delete the run directory immediately after successful output upload
* `--delete-after failure` to delete the directory after failure
* `--delete-after always` to delete it in either case
* (or set environment variable `MINIWDL__AWS__DELETE_AFTER_S3_UPLOAD`)

Deleting a run directory after success prevents the outputs from being reused in future runs. Deleting it after failures can make debugging more difficult (although logs are retained, see below).

### Security note on file system isolation

Going through AWS Batch & EFS, miniwdl can't enforce the strict file system isolation between WDL task containers that it does locally. All the AWS Batch containers have read/write access to the entire EFS file system (as viewed through the access point), not only their initial working directory.

This is usually benign, because WDL tasks should only read their declared inputs and write into their respective working/temporary directories. But poorly- or maliciously-written tasks could read & write files elsewhere on EFS, even changing their own input files or those of other tasks. This risks unintentional side-effects or worse security hazards from untrusted code.

To mitigate this, test workflows thoroughly using the local backend, which strictly isolates task containers' file systems. If WDL tasks insist on modifying their input files in place, then `--copy-input-files` can unblock them (at a cost in time, space, and IOPS). Lastly, avoid using untrusted WDL code or container images; but if they're necessary, then use a separate EFS access point and restrict the IAM and network configuration for the AWS Batch containers appropriately.

### EFS performance considerations

To scale up to larger workloads, it's important to study AWS documentation on EFS [performance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/performance.html) and [monitoring](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/monitoring-cloudwatch.html). Like any network file system, EFS limits on throughput and IOPS can cause bottlenecks; and worse, throughput burst credit exhaustion can effectively freeze a workflow.

Management tips:

* Monitor file system throughput limits, IOPS, and burst credits in the EFS area of the AWS Console.
* Create the file system in "Max I/O" performance mode.
* Stage large datasets onto the file system well in advance, increasing the available burst throughput.
* Temporarily provision higher throughput than bursting mode provides (24-hour minimum provisioning commitment).
* Configure miniwdl and AWS Batch to limit the number of concurrent jobs and/or the rate at which they turn over (see [miniwdl_aws.cfg](https://github.com/miniwdl-ext/miniwdl-aws/blob/main/miniwdl_aws.cfg) for relevant details).
* Spread out separate workflow runs over time or across multiple EFS file systems.

## Logs & troubleshooting

If the terminal log isn't available (through Studio or `miniwdl-submit-awsbatch --follow`) to trace a workflow failure, look for miniwdl's usual log files written in the run directory on EFS or copied to S3.

Each task job's log is also forwarded to [CloudWatch Logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/WhatIsCloudWatchLogs.html) under the `/aws/batch/job` group and a log stream name reported in miniwdl's log. Using `miniwdl-aws-submit`, the workflow job's log is also forwarded. CloudWatch Logs indexes the logs for structured search through the AWS Console & API.

Misconfigured infrastructure might prevent logs from being written to EFS or CloudWatch at all. In that case, use the AWS Batch console/API to find status messages for the workflow or task jobs.

Recommendations:

* Compute environments
    * Modify spot instance launch template to relocate docker operations onto NVMe or an [autoscaling volume](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-ebs-autoscale) instead of the root EBS volume
    * Set task environment allocation strategy to `SPOT_CAPACITY_OPTIMIZED` and spot bid policies as needed
    * Set task environment spot `bidPercentage` as needed
    * Temporarily set task environment `minvCpus` to reduce scheduling delays during periods of interactive use
* EFS
    * Create in One Zone mode, and restrict compute environments to the same zone (trading off availability for cost)
    * Create in Max I/O mode
    * Configure EFS Access Point to use a nonzero user ID, with an owned filesystem root directory
* Use non-default VPC security group for EFS & compute environments
    * EFS must be accessible to all containers through TCP port 2049
    * Add `--no-public-ip` if the workflow compute environment has private subnet(s) & NAT
